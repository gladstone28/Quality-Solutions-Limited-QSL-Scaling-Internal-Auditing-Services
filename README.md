# Pitch to Potential Investors

**Quality Solutions Limited (QSL) -- Scaling Internal Auditing
Services**

## Introduction

Quality Solutions Limited (QSL) is a registered Jamaican management
consultancy with a proven track record in guiding organizations toward
operational excellence. Building on our expertise and reputation, we are
expanding our portfolio to include **Internal Auditing Services for ISO
9001 (Quality Management) and ISO 27001 (Information Security
Management)**.

We see a significant opportunity to serve businesses in **Jamaica, the
wider Caribbean, and internationally**---regions where compliance with
global standards is both a competitive advantage and a regulatory
necessity.

## The Market Opportunity

-   **Rising demand for ISO standards**: Businesses face increasing
    pressure from regulators, customers, and investors to demonstrate
    compliance with internationally recognized standards in quality and
    information security.\
-   **Untapped Caribbean market**: Many local and regional businesses
    aspire to become export-ready or secure international contracts but
    lack the internal auditing capacity to meet certification
    requirements.\

    allowing QSL to extend services beyond the Caribbean through digital
    and hybrid auditing models.

    staff, QSL can deliver internal audits at competitive rates while
    maintaining global best practices.\
4.  **Strategic Positioning** -- Few firms in the Caribbean offer
    specialized ISO auditing at an international standard. QSL is poised
    to fill this gap.
